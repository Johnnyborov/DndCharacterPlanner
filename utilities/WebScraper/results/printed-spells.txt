When initiative is rolled, the familiar also rolls, but it can't make an attack. It can take other actions, but if its hit points fall to 0, it disappears until you cast this spell again.

The damage appears to the target to be caused by some attack or effect that is natural to the illusion.

Description: You inscribe a glyph either upon a surface or within an object that can be closed to hide it. It can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast the spell, it ends without being triggered. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. Once the glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics, creature kind, or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph.
The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Investigation check to be found.
When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.

* Explosive Runes: When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature must make a Dexterity save. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failure (your choice when you create the glyph), or half damage on a success.
* Spell Glyph: You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the triggering creature. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile or harmful things, they appear as close as possible to the creature and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts for the full duration.
At Higher Levels: The damage of an explosive rune glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.

* Part Water: You cause the water to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area. The separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. Once the spell ends, the water refills in the trench over the course of the next round.
* Redirect Flow: You cause flowing water to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow in unlikely directions. The water moves as you direct it, but once it's out of the spell's area, it resumes flow based on the terrain. The water moves until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.
* Whirlpool: You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of a body of water at least 50 feet wide and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool is a vortex 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. Swimming away requires an Athletics check. When a creature enters the vortex or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength save. On failure, it takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't caught. A creature caught can use its action to try to swim away, but has disadvantage the check. The first time an object enters the vortex, it takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage. This damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

At the end of its turns, it can repeat the save. A Huge or larger creature succeeds automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail.
The sphere can restrain four Medium or smaller creatures, or one Large creature. If the sphere exceeds this capacity, a random creature that was restrained falls out and lands prone within 5 feet.
As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a drop-off, it descends until it's hovering by 10 feet. Any creature restrained moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the save.
When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet. Any creature restrained is knocked prone in the space where it falls. The water vanishes.

Description: Choose up to ten nonmagical objects that are not being worn or carried. A Medium target counts as two objects, a Large counts as four, and a Huge counts as eight. You can't animate an object larger than Huge. Each target becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or it's reduced to 0 hit points.
As a bonus action, you can mentally command a creatures if it's within 500 feet of you. You can command multiple at the same time if the command is the same. You decide what action and movement the creature will take during its next turn, or issue a general command. If you issue no commands, it just defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until it's complete.
		Size		HP		AC		Attack		Strength		Dexterity
		Tiny		20		18		+8 to hit, 1d4+4 damage		4		18

		Huge		80		10		+8 to hit, 2d12+4 damage		18		6

An animated object is a construct with some stats determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10, its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet. If it can't walk, it has a flying speed of 30 feet and hovers. If the object is securely attached to something, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet. When the object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and remaining damage carries over.
It can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The attack is determined by its size and deals bludgeoning damage. The DM can rule that it inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.
At Higher Levels: You can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hp, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 and a Dexterity of 10. The hand doesn't fill its space.
When you cast the spell, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, the hand can move up to 60 feet and cause one of the following effects:

* Clenched Fist: The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet. Make a melee spell attack using your statistics. On a successful hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.
* Forceful Hand: The hand pushes a creature within 5 feet in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength against the target's Athletics. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet, plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting modifier. The hand moves with the target.
* Grasping Hand: The hand grapples a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage. While grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand deal 2d6 + your spellcasting modifier of bludgeoning damage.
* Interposing Hand: The hand places itself between you and a creature of your choice until you give it a different command. It moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover. The target can't move through the hand if its Strength is less than or equal to the hand's. If its score is higher than the hand's, the target can move toward you through the hand, but the space is difficult terrain.

The devil is unfriendly toward you and your companions. Roll initiative for it. It is under the Dungeon Master's control and acts according to its nature.
On your turn, you can use a free action to issue a verbal command. It obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with its desires. Otherwise, you must make a Charisma check contested by its Insight. You have advantage if you say the devil's true name. If your check fails, the devil becomes immune to your verbal commands, though it can follow them if it chooses. If your check succeeds, the devil carries out your command until it completes the activity, at which point it returns to you to report having done so.
If your concentration ends before the duration is up, the devil doesn't disappear if it's immune to your verbal commands. Instead, it acts however it chooses for 3d6 minutes, and then disappears.
If you possess an individual devil's talisman, you can summon that devil if it is of the appropriate challenge rating plus 1, and it obeys all your commands with no Charisma check required.

Transmute Rock to Mud. Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick and flowing mud that remains for the spell's duration.
If you cast the spell on an area of ground, it becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make this save the first time it enters the area on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, though it can use an action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.
If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Transmute Mud to Rock. Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. The restrained creature can use an action to try to break free by succeeding on a Strength check (DC 20) or by dealing 25 damage to the rock around it. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface to an unoccupied space.

If the wall is in a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to a side of the wall that you choose. If a creature would be surrounded on all sides, it can make a Dexterity save. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it's not trapped.
The wall can have any shape you desire, but it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical, or rest on a firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports.
Each panel has an AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.
If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and cannot be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

Components: V S M (100gp or more gem; consumed)
Duration: Conc. Up to 1 hour
Description: You summon a vrock that appears in an unoccupied space you can see. It disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The vrock's attitude depends on the value of the gem used as a material component for this spell. Roll initiative for the vrock. At the start of its turn, the DM makes a secret Charisma check for you, with a bonus equal to the gem's value divided by 20. The DC starts at 10 and increases by 2 each round. You can issue orders to the vrock that it will obey if you succeed on the check.
If you fail on the check, the vrock is no longer controlled and your concentration ends. The vrock takes no actions on its next turn and uses its telepathy to tell creatures it can see that it'll fight in exchange for treasure. The creature that gives the most expensive gem can command it for the next 1d6 rounds. At the end of that time, it offers again. If no one offers anything before the vrock's next turn begins, it attacks the nearest creatures for 1d6 rounds, then returns to the Abyss.
As part of casting the spell, you can make a circle on the ground using the blood of an intelligent humanoid killed in the last 24 hours. The circle encompasses your space. The summoned vrock can't cross the circle or target anyone in it while the spell lasts.

Each pillar has a diameter of 5 feet, a height of up to 30 feet, an AC of 5, and 30 hit points.

If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity save or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.
If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (creature's choice).

You can mentally command a ghoul as a bonus action if they are within 120 feet of you. You can command multiples at once if you issue the same command.

The spell creates the following effects. When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures who are immune to the effects. You can also make a password that makes whoever says it immune to these effects.
The entire area radiates magic. Dispel Magic removes one effect, not the entire area. The caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all effects are gone is the grove dispelled.

* Solid Fog: You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily obscured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. Every foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a creature immune to this effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like mist.
* Grasping Undergrowth: You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren't filled with fog with grasping weeds and vines, as if they were an Entangle spell. To a creature immune to this effect, the plants feel soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats and beds.
* Grove Guardians: You animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to uproot themselves. They have the same statistics as an awakened tree, except they can't speak and their bark is covered with druidic symbols. If a creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the guardians fight them until they have driven off or killed the intruders. The guardians also obey your spoken commands that you issue while in the area. If you don't give them commands and no intruders are present, the guardians do nothing. The guardians can't leave the warded area. When the spell ends, they are no longer animated and take root again if possible.
* Additional Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects. To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a gentle breeze and the Spike Growth is harmless.
 A constant Gust of Wind in two locations of your choice
 Spike Growth in one location of your choice
 Wind Wall in two locations of your choice

The available options are as follows:

* Doors: All doors are magically locked as if by Arcane Lock. You can also hide up to ten doors with a Minor Illusion-like cover to make them appear as sections of the wall.

Category: Level 6 Spell
Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V S M (500gp gem, crystal or ornamental container)
Duration: Until dispelled
Description: Your soul enters the container you used to cast the spell. While you're in the container, your body is comatose, and you perceive the world from inside the jar. The only action you can do is project your soul up to 100 feet outside of the container. You either return to your body and end the spell, or attempt to possess another humanoid's body. You can't move, use reactions, or perform any other actions while in the jar.
You may only possess humanoids that you can see and that aren't guarded by a Protection from Evil and Good or Magic Circle spell. Your target must make a Charisma save. On a failure, your soul possesses the target and the target's soul is put inside the container. On a success, it knows that you tried to possess it and is immune to your possession for 24 hours.
If you possess a creature, you take control of it and assume all of its game statistics except alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You also keep your own class features, and don't use class features the target has.
You can use your action to stop possessing and return to the jar if the container is within 100 feet of you. The creature's soul returns to its body.
If the creature's body dies while you possess it, the creature dies and you must make a Charisma save against your spell DC. On a success, if the container is within 100 feet of you, you return to it. Otherwise, you die too.
A creature trapped in the container can see from inside it as normal, but can't move, take actions, or take reactions.
If the spell ends or the container is destroyed, the soul tries to return to its body. This is successful only if the body is alive and within 100 feet of the container; otherwise, the soul dies.
Once the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

Description: You suggest an activity up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear and understand you. You're limited to two sentences. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune. The suggestion must be worded to make the action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do something obviously self-harmful ends the spell.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed. If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

Time: 1 Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V,S,M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils - clay, loam, and sand)
Duration: Concentration, up to 2 hours
Description: Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such change can't exceed half the area's largest dimension So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.
At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.
Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.
This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.
Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

Components: V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description: A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.
If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.
You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 GP)
Duration: Until dispelled
Description: You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.
When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.
The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

Description: This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell. While you have a soul inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can't be revived.
Steal Life. You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain 2d8 hit points.
Query Soul. You can ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.
Borrow Experience. You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul's life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don't use this before the start of your next turn, it is lost.
Eyes of the Dead. You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you're currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were concentrating on a spell). You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.
A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using see invisibility or truesight) sees a translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you cased.

Description: An immobile, invisible, cube--shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.
A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2--inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.
A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.
When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.
A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect.

Description: You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape remains the same, however, open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy Meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.
Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
The illusions include audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.
Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

Duration: 24 hours
Description: You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.
Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a ninecourse banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can't leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.

Description: You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.
You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.
You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

Duration: Until dispelled
Description: You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature's hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.
The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.
If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.
If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.

Description: You inscribe a glyph either upon a surface or within an object that can be closed to hide it. It can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast the spell, it ends without being triggered. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. Once the glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics, creature kind, or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph.
The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Investigation check to be found.
When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below. Once triggered, the glyph glows a 60-foot-radius dim light sphere for 10 minutes, after which the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates, and any creature that enters the sphere or ends its turn there, is affected.

* Death: Each target must make a Constitution save, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half on a success.
* Discord: Each target must make a Constitution save. On a failed save, a target is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 minute.
* Fear: Each target must pass a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the target drops whatever it's holding and moves at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns.
* Hopelessness: Each target must make a Charisma save. On a failed save, the target can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects for 1 minute.
* Insanity: Each target must make an Intelligence save. On a failed save, the target can't take actions, can't understand what others say, can't read, speaks gibberish, and has erratic movement for 1 minute.

* Sleep: Each target must pass a Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to wake it up.

Description: You and up to eight willing creatures you can see, or a single object you can see, teleport to a destination you choose. If you pick an object, it must be able to fit completely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by a creature unwilling to let it teleport.
The destination must be a place you know and is on the same plane of existence. Roll a d100 to determine how successfully you get there, based on how well you know the place.

Familiarity:

* Permanent circle refers to a permanent teleportation circle you know.
* Associated object means you have an item from the destination, taken in the last 6 months.
* Very familiar is a place you've been to often, studied a lot, or a place you can see at casting.
* Seen casually is some place you've seen more than once.
* Viewed once is a place you've seen once.
* Description is a place that you only know through words, not first-hand experience.
* False destination is a place that doesn't exist. If you're teleporting to a familiar place that no longer exists, it would be rolled as a false destination.
Results:

* On target means you appear where you meant to.
* Off target means you appear at a d10 x d10 percent of the distance that was traveled away from the destination. The direction is random, determined by a d8. 1 is north, and each number's direction progresses clockwise.
* Similar area means you appear in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the destination.
* Mishap means everything being teleported takes 3d10 force damage and the d100 is rolled again. Multiple mishaps can occur and deal damage each time.

Duration: 24 hours
Range: You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground you can see within range. The temple must fit within an unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting.
Components: You make all decisions about the temple's appearance. The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.
Duration: The temple's interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.
Description: The temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.
In addition, the sensors created by divination spell can't appear inside the temple, and creatures within can't be targeted by divination spells.
Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point).
The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple's interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple's exterior. It can't be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly.
Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

If a creature enters the whirlwind's space, or the whirlwind passes over a creature, the creature must make a Dexterity save. This includes when the whirlwind appears. It takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage if it fails, and half if it saves. If it's Large or smaller and fails, it makes a Strength save. If it fails that, it's restrained by the whirlwind and dragged along with it as it moves. It's dropped to the ground when the spell ends. At the start of its turns, it's brought 5 feet up into the whirlwind until it reaches the top.
A restrained creature can spend its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check. If it passes, it's thrown 3d6 x 10 feet in a random direction out of the whirlwind.

Description: You summon a hezrou that appears in an unoccupied space you can see. It disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The hezrou's attitude depends on the value of the food used as a material component for this spell. Roll initiative for the hezrou. At the start of its turn, the DM makes a secret Charisma check for you, with a bonus equal to the food's value divided by 20. The DC starts at 10 and increases by 2 each round. You can issue orders to the hezrou that it will obey if you succeed on the check.
If you fail on the check, your concentration ends and the hezrou is no longer controlled. It focuses on devouring any corpses it can see. If there are none, it attacks the nearest creature and eats anything it kills. If its hit points are reduced to below half its maximum, it returns to the Abyss.
As part of casting the spell, you can make a circle on the ground using the blood of an intelligent humanoid killed in the last 24 hours. The circle encompasses your space. The summoned hezrou can't cross the circle or target anyone in it while the spell lasts.

Description: Choose a Huge or smaller object, creature, or area no bigger than a 200-foot cube, then specify an intelligent creature. The target gains an aura of antipathy, which repels the intelligent creature, or sympathy, which draws the creature to it. You choose the aura.
In the antipathy aura, creatures of the chosen type must make a Wisdom save if they can see the target or when they come within 60 feet of it. If it fails, it's frightened and must use its movement to get to the nearest safe spot where it can't see the target. If the creature gets more than 60 feet away and can't see the target, they are no longer frightened but will become so again if they get within the aura or see the target.
The sympathy aura causes creatures of the chosen type to pass a Wisdom save, or use their movement to enter the area if they see the target or move within reach of the target if they're within 60 feet. Once the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away. If the target harms the creature, it can make another Wisdom save.
If the creature successfully saves, it's no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling as magical. Additionally, a creature affected can make a Wisdom save every 24 hours. Any creature that successfully saves is immune for 1 minute, then can be affected again.

Description: A creature you see must pass a Wisdom save or be charmed. If you're fighting it, it has advantage.
While charmed, you have a telepathic link to it if you're on the same plane. You can use this link to issue commands it obeys, no action required. You can specify a simple and general course of action. If it completes the order and doesn't receive further orders, it only defends itself.
You can use your action to take total control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you decide and nothing you don't allow it to. You can also have the creature use a reaction, but this takes your reaction as well.
If the target takes damage, it makes another Wisdom save. On a success, the spell ends.

Description: For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on a point you can see. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground must make a concentration save if applicable.
When you cast this spell, and at the end of your turns, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it's knocked prone.
This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.

* Fissures: 1d6 fissures open in the spell's area at the start of your next turn in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must pass a Dexterity save or fall in. A creature that saves moves with the fissure's edge. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse.
* Structures: The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground when you cast the spell and at the start of your turns. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses. Any creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a Dexterity save. On a failure, it takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble. It can make a DC 20 Athletics check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.

Description: A square fortress of stone appears from the ground at an area you can see. The area must be 120 feet on each side and not have any buildings or other structures in it. Creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted.
The fortress has four turrets with square bases that are 20 feet wide and 30 feet tall. There is one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected by 80-feet-long stone walls that are 1 foot thick and made of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. You can place up to four doors on the outer wall.
A square keep, 50 feet on each side with three 10-foot-high floors, is in the center of the fortress. The floors can have as many rooms as desired, but each one must be at least 5 feet on each side. Rooms can be connected by doors or archways and have whatever furniture desired. The keep also has food to serve a nine-course meal to 100 people each day. If objects in the keep are taken outside the fortress, they become dust. The keep's floors are connected by staircases. Each wall of the keep is 6 inches thick.
100 invisible servants come with the fortress and can be commanded by creatures you pick when you cast the spell. The servants act as though made by Unseen Servant.
Each 10x10ft section of the fortress has 30 hit points and 15 AC per inch of thickness, and is immune to poison and psychic damage. If a section is reduced to 0 hit points, it's destroyed, and the DM may rule other sections collapse as well.
If the spell is cast elsewhere or 7 days pass, the fortress sinks back into the ground. Creatures inside it are harmlessly set on the ground. Casting this spell every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends.
A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it can't move. A creature that moves out of the area falls to the ground.

Description: You and up to eight willing creatures within range project yourselves into the Astral Plane. The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation.
Your astral body resembles your normal form in almost every way. The main difference is a cord that extends from your back and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. If the cord is cut, you die instantly.
Your astral form can pass through portals leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on, your body and possessions are transported, allowing you to re-enter your body. Any damage or other effects that apply to your astral form have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body and awakens.
A successful Dispel Magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature's original body or astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for it and it returns to its body.
If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies.

Duration: Until dispelled
Description: You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.
When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.
Burial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.
The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.
Chaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then.
The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.
Hedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.
The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.
Minimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.
The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.
Slumber. The target falls asleep and can't be awoken.
The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.
Ending the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.
A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.
You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, and you can choose the same form or different ones for each target. The new form can be any beast you have seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or half the target's level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target retains its hit points, alignment, and personality.
Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new form. These temporary hit points can't be replaced by temporary hit points from another source. A target reverts to its normal form when it has no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal form.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form. It can't speak, cast spells, or do anything else that requires hands or speech.
The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

Description: A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall-up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick-centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot is wasted.
The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100ÿfeet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.
The wall consists of seven layers, each with aÿdifferent color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.
The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. An antimagic field has no effect on it, and dispel magic works only against the violet layer.
1. Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.
2. Orange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.ÿ
3. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.ÿ
4. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. ÿ
5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it. ÿ
6. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.ÿ
7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.

You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you, and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of yours. You can't use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.
You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hitpoints, you aren't knocked unconscious.
You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.
When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.
During this spell's duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.

Duration: Conc. Up to 1 minute
Description: A 360-foot-radius storm cloud appears in the sky at a point you can see. Each creature less than 5,000 feet below the cloud makes a Constitution save when it appears, taking 2d6 thunder damage and being deafened for 5 minutes if they fail.
The longer you concentrate on this spell, the more effects will occur. Each takes place on a specific round.

* Round 2: Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.
* Round 3: Six lightning bolts all strike different creatures or objects of your choice. A struck creature makes a Dexterity save, taking 10d6 lightning damage if they fail and half if they succeed.
* Round 4: Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
* Round 5-10: The area under the cloud becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. In addition, each creature takes 1d6 cold damage and ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. Any fog, mists, and the like, magical or not, are dispersed due to strong winds. The storm is a severe distraction to maintaining concentration on a spell.

Description: You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while youÿtake 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal. This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you.
In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.

Time: 1 Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description: Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.
This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.
Creature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or its level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.
The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its new form is capable of such actions.
The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
Object into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's size and the creature's challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature's statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.
If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.
Creature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature's statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.

Description: You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature's soul is free and willing, it's restored to life with all its hit points.
This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.
The spell can provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature's name. The creature appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.

Description: Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30?foot?radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat.
At the end of each of the frightened creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage.
On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Description: You can duplicate a spell of level 8 or lower without needing to meet any requirements, material components with a cost included.
Alternatively, you create one of the following effects:

* A non-magic item worth up to 25,000 gp appears in an empty space on the ground. It can't be more than 300 feet in any dimension.
* Up to 20 creatures you can see regain all hit points and end all effects listed in Greater Restoration.
* Up to 10 creatures you can see gain resistance to a damage type you choose.
* Up to 10 creatures you can see gain immunity to a spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.
* You force a re-roll of any roll made within the last round, your turn included. You can force the re-roll to be made with advantage or disadvantage. Additionally, you can choose whether or not to use the re-roll.
You can do effects unlisted by stating your wish as precisely as possible. However, the DM has full ruling on what the wish does. The greater the wish, the greater the likelihood of something going wrong. This can range from the spell failing, to only getting part of the effect, to getting an undesired consequence.
If you use Wish to do anything besides duplicate a spell, you suffer the following effects:

* Each time you cast a spell, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per spell level. This damage can't be reduced or prevented. This effect ends after a long rest.
* Your Strength score becomes 3 if not so already for 2d4 days. If you spend a day doing nothing but resting or light activity, your recovery time decreases by 2 days.
* A die that can be split into thirds is rolled. Designate one third before doing so. If you roll a number in this third, you can't cast Wish ever again.
